## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that using vh or viewport height very useful.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.main {
    position: relative;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
}
```
### Continued development

I want to focus more on css property value like position: relative & absolute.

### Useful resources
